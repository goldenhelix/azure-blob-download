    Download files from Azure Blob Storage using rclone.

    To get the SAS URL for Azure Blob Storage, follow these steps:

    1. Go to the Azure Portal and navigate to your Storage Account.
    2. Select the container you want to access.
    3. In the left menu, click on Settings > Shared access tokens.
    4. Configure the following settings:
       - Signing method  use Account key (default).
       - Signing key: Choose Key 1 or Key 2 as needed 
       - Stored access policy: None (unless you have a policy)
       - Permissions: Select at least Read and List (and others as needed)
       - Start and expiry date/time: Set the appropriate window for access
       - Allowed IP addresses: (Optional) Restrict access to specific IPs if desired
       - Allowed protocols: Select HTTPS only for security
    5. Click the Generate SAS token and URL button at the bottom.
    6. Copy the Blob SAS URL that is generated. This will be used as the sas_url parameter in this task.

    Note:
    The SAS URL provides temporary, restricted access to your blob storage. Make sure to set an appropriate expiration time and permissions for your use case.
